## Prerequsite

Please first install [node](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm#using-a-node-installer-to-install-nodejs-and-npm) and npm (installing node will include npm).

## Install

After node is installed, now run the following cmds in order to see my portfolio.

### `npm install`

`npm install` will install all the dependencies.

`npm start` boots the react app to your default browswer, or you can manually go to the link to `localhost:port` (usually `localhost:3000/`).
